## MS-VRCSA Billiards  
  
A VRChat Billiards table by Neko Mabel and Sacchan  
  
This table is a fork of the Pool Parlor table by metaphira and Toasterly  
Originally coded by Harry-T  
  
The aim of this table is provide an updated and improved Pool table that is as realistic* as possible for cue sports enthusiasts, while also providing quality of life enhancements and useful features that everyone can enjoy.  
See it in action in the VRChat world 'Sacc's Snooker Club'  
  
### Features  
- New game set up menu:  
	- Choose table to play on (developers can make their own table models and distribute them!)  
	- Choose physics script to use (developers can use this to experiment while not breaking functionality!)  
- New extra menu:  
	- Cue length and movement smoothing sliders  
	- Undo, redo, and skip turn are always available during multiplayer matches:  
		- Allows undoing of accidental hits  
		- Allows viewing of previous shots  
		- Needless to say, this change assumes greater trust between players but I think it'll be okay.  
- Remade player join menu:  
	- Players can leave and join the match at any time  
	- No worries about disconnections - late joiners can join in  
	- When there's only a single player, practice mode automatically activates, enabling shot-set up and multiplayer practice sessions  
- Save/Load menu for shots (originally made by eijis-pan):  
	- Save a ball layout or actual shot (by saving while the simulation is running)  
	- Save the ball layout from someone else's game and try the shot yourself on another table!  
	- Extremely useful for bug testing!  
- Greatly improved ball physics:  
	- Re-written all ball collision functions  
	- All balls now use a collision prediction step to ensure accurate ball-to-ball collisions, and that they will never clip through the corners of cushions  
	- Sub-step physics - All balls now run extra physics steps if they hit something to ensure they move the full distance they should have in the step time  
	- Enhanced 3D physics:  
		- All balls are equal - All balls can jump and bounce. Hitting cushions too fast can cause jumping  
		- On rail physics - balls can roll around on top of the side rail, and fall in to pockets from it  
		- Place balls on top of the rail in practice mode by clicking while holding them to change placement mode  
- Snooker rule set:  
	- Complete rule set for 6-red Snooker has been implemented using (WPBSA - rule set) https://wpbsa.com/wp-content/uploads/Rulebook-Website-Updated-May-2022-2.pdf [Page 34]  
- Greater table customization:  
	- Almost every vertex of the collision model is adjustable, and shown by the in-editor visualizer script for easy setup  
	- Each table has it's own physics settings  
- Misc:  
	- Local build and test works fine with two clients for testing (Now syncing player ID instead of player name)  
	- 3D pockets - balls actually have to fall down a bit before they count as pocketed  
	- Balls don't freeze the instant they're pocketed  
	- LoD system to disable simulation and visuals when far away  
- 6 Tables included  
	- The original prefab table  
	- Accurate to real 7-8-9ft Pool tables  
	- Accurate to real 10 and 12ft Snooker tables  
  
### Setup:  
Import the package  
Click MS-VRCSA->Set Up Pool Table Layers  
	- this names layer 22 to 'BilliardsModule' and sets the collision matrix so that it only collides with itself  
Place one or more Prefab/MS-VRCA Table prefabs into your scene  
Because tables can be swapped out they can't easily be lightmapped. Use just one table if you wish to have light mapping  
	- Remove the unused tables from the list in BilliardsModule and delete their objects  
  
### Table Creation  
Copy the hierarchy of the existing tables and you should be fine, objects whose name begin with a period are used in the code, so don't change their names.  
The shader for the table's Metallic/Smoothness texture can be exported as a 2 channel png with photoshop's Export As and ticking the '[x]Smaller Filer (8-bit)' option  
  
### Known issues  
- It's possible for a player to be unable to grab their cue when it's their turn, leaving and re-joining the match fixes this issue. (rare)  
  
### Future  
There's still a lot that can be done to improve things - I don't intend to do any more major work on this myself - Sacchan  
- Stuff that could be useful for worlds like support for custom ball and table skins  
- A system to export shots from an entire match for preservation  
- Snooker with 15 red balls:  
	- Requires more synced data and simulation, might be best to implement as a fork

- 9Ball Rules:  
	- 9Ball push out rule  
- Further improvements to physics  
- Misscues  
- New sound effects  
- Optimization - may not be necessary with udon2 coming soon  
- 10Ball mode  
- Other standards for 8/9ball (WPA ..)  
- I have completely neglected the Quest setup stuff, idk if it still works, never used it  
- I have completely removed the referee stuff, there's probably a simpler way to handle it now, and 99% of people wont use it  
- Message me if you're a programmer and need help working something out  
  
### Credits

- Everything else  
  
### Changes in version 1.11  
Guideline2 no longer visible outside of practice mode  
Add 5s and 10s timer options  
Fixed diamond positions on Classic table  
Stop using US colors as default in 8ball  
  
### Major Changes in version 1.1  
Implemented more rules from the APA standard  
	- Soft break is a foul (4 balls must touch cushion)  
	- Balls must touch cushion (or pocket) after colliding  
	- Golden breaks  
	- Scratch on break means ball in hand is limited to kitchen  
	- Never choose color set if both colors are pocketed (even if 2blue, 1orange)  
Internal table collision setup re-worked  
	- Table width/height settings now properly represents the exact play area  
	- This made me realize some initial ball spots were wrong - now all fixed  
Collision visualizer improved  
	- No longer has a weird delay when changing variables in the inspector  
	- Has cricles accurately representing the actual collision shape of the corners  
	- Fixed an issue where the cushion height was displayed slightly shorter than it should have been  
Desktop mode updates  
	- Fixed the functionality of the Q key - you can now click and drag balls around as intended  
	- change the redo button from ctrl-y to ctrl-x (Y opens the chat box in VRC, which you can't even see when in desktop view)  
Added a second faint guideline showing the cue direction, this should help beginners hit the ball straight  
Added 3 new tables Pool 8ft, 9ft, and Snooker 10ft  
Fixed some bugs with the LoD system that sometimes caused spectators to see the wrong game mode being played  
Fixed bug where if a player took a shot and then left the world before the balls settled, the table would need to be reset  
Added ability to place balls on top of the rail in practice mode, click while holding a ball to change placement mode (normal, on rail, in-air)  
Added Snooker tie rule, in the case of a tie, the black is replaced, and a random player gets to shoot  
Added Sliders to the table shader to allow HSV color change of the cloth  
Removed compression from save/load, shots are no longer slightly different after loading
